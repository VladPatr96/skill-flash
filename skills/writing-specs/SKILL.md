# Writing Specs

A spec removes guesswork from execution. The executor should not need unscripted exploration.

## Required Sections

1. **Goal.** One sentence describing user-visible outcome.
2. **Context.** Files, contracts, prior decisions, relevant excerpts.
3. **Impact.** What depends on the changed area and what could break.
4. **Metadata.** Complexity, conflict paths, parallel safety, dependencies, tooling opportunity.
5. **Resolved choices.** Decision plus one-line rationale for every branch.
6. **Steps.** Ordered edits; for code, prefer failing check before fix.
7. **Boundaries.** What not to touch.
8. **DoD and checks.** Exact command, scenario, or review evidence.

## Readiness Check

- Could a new executor complete it without asking a question?
- Are all choices made by the spec author?
- Is verification executable by a fresh context?
- Is the diff budget realistic?
- Is the carrier status set: issue label or file frontmatter?

If an executor improvises, treat it as a spec defect and fix the spec.
